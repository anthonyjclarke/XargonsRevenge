A full copy of the Disk found a few years ago, still work to do to understand how to recompile.  And what many of the files are for! I must have had a templated framework I used for all my C16 games!

My recollection was that this was developed on a C64 with a 1541 diskette drive and then compiled and the diskette moved over to a 1541 attached to the C16 and run from there.
